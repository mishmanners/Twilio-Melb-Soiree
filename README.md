# 🎨 Twilio WhatsApp Cartoon Generator

A WhatsApp bot that transforms user selfies into anime-style cartoons using Twilio, OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, and image generation capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **WhatsApp Integration**: Receive and respond to messages via Twilio
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini with image generation tools
- 🎭 **Cartoon Style Transformation**: Converts user photos into caricature-style images
- 🖼️ **Automatic Processing**: Processes images in the background and sends results back
- 📁 **File Management**: Automatically organizes generated images

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Twilio** - WhatsApp messaging API
- **OpenAI** - AI image generation and processing
- **Axios** - HTTP client for media downloads
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp sandbox configured
- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o-mini and image generation
- A public URL for webhooks (ngrok, Heroku, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd twilio_whatsapp_cartoongenerator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Prepare the mask image**
   
   Make sure you have a `mask.png` file in the `input/` directory. This image is used as a background/mask for the anime transformation.

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   # Development mode with auto-reload
   npm run dev
   
   # Or standard mode
   node server.js
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Twilio Setup

1. Create a Twilio account and get your Account SID and Auth Token
2. Set up WhatsApp sandbox in the Twilio Console
3. Configure your webhook URL to point to `https://your-domain.com/message`

### OpenAI Setup

1. Get an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI platform
2. Ensure your account has access to GPT-4o-mini and image generation capabilities

## 📱 Usage

1. **Start a conversation** with your configured WhatsApp number
2. **Send a selfie** - The bot will respond that your image is being processed
3. **Wait for processing** - The AI will transform your photo into an anime-style cartoon
4. **Receive the result** - The bot will send back your transformed image

- `POST /message` - Webhook endpoint for Twilio WhatsApp messages
- `GET /` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /{messageId}.png` - Serves generated cartoon images

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Message Reception**: Twilio webhook receives WhatsApp messages
2. **Image Processing**: If an image is received, it's downloaded and processed
3. **AI Transformation**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates an anime-style version using the mask image
4. **Response**: The generated cartoon is saved and sent back via WhatsApp
